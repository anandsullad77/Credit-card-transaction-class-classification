## Challenges and Learnings

### Challenges
During the course of this project, several challenges were encountered:

- **Data Imbalance**: The dataset showed a significant class imbalance, posing a challenge for accurate model prediction, especially for the minority class.
  - **Approach**: Techniques such as oversampling the minority class with SMOTE, undersampling the majority class, and experimenting with different evaluation metrics were utilized to address this issue.


- **Model Selection and Tuning**: Selecting the right model and tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance required numerous iterations and experiments.
  - **Approach**: Started with a baseline model and gradually experimented with more complex models. Utilized grid search and cross-validation techniques to fine-tune the model parameters.

### Learnings
Key learnings from the project include:

- **Strategies for Handling Imbalanced Data**: Gained practical experience with techniques for dealing with imbalanced datasets, which is a common issue in many real-world scenarios.
- **Experimentation and Persistence**: The importance of experimenting with different approaches and the value of persistence in problem-solving.
- **Model Explainability**: The importance of model interpretability and explainability, especially in sensitive fields like finance, to build trust with stakeholders.
